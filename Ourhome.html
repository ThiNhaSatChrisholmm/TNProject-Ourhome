        <h2>Location</h2>
            <p >It is in one of Reservoir's best lifestyle locations with the inspired purchase of this four-bedroom double-brick beauty.

                With Crispe Reserve, Wright Avenue Reserve (and its children's playground) and Edwardes Lake Park all within short walking distance, living here will give your lifestyle a healthy boost. Factor in walking distance access to the buzzing Edwardes Street shopping and dining strip, St Gabriel's Primary School, bus services and Reservoir and Regent train stations and close proximity of Regent Village, the No.11 tram, Preston Market and medical clinics and it's evidently a location that comfortably satisfies every lifestyle need.
                
                Four bright bedrooms make this home ideal for a young family, particularly when you consider the large proportions of the north-facing grassed backyard overseen by an undercover entertaining area.
                
                Polished hardwood floors flow beautifully throughout the welcoming living area on entry, while a spacious separate kitchen area, high ceilings, separate laundry and a tandem carport adds further appeal.
